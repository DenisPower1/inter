# What is Interfy?

Interfy is an easy to use and learn Javascript library for robust client-side routing.

It's was created especially to be used in [apps created with Inter](http://interjs.epizy.com) but you can use it in any kind of app that requires a front-end routing.


It is easy, simple, small and powerful.
